# Snake-cpp-MVC
Snake-cpp-MVC is a classic Snake game written in C++ that uses MVC pattern with an interchangeable front-end. The goal of the game is to control a snake that moves around the board, eating as many fruits as possible and avoiding collisions with itself and the walls of the board. Player scores points for each fruit eaten, while increasing the length of the snake. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edge of the board.
