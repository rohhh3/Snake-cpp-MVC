# Snake-cpp-MVC
Snake-cpp-MVC is a classic Snake game written in C++ in the MVC structure. The goal of the project is to learn about programming in the MVC structure. The program has been written in such a way that the View can be changed in the future without interfering with the Model or Controller structure. In the current version, the user uses a console interface.

## Installation guide
